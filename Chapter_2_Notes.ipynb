    "## Russian (Egyptian) Peasant (Probably Not) Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Enables people to multiply large numbers without the usage of the multiplication table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two columns:\n",
    "    - Left: Halving (Put in first multiplier)\n",
    "        - Each row halves the previous, ignore the remainder\n",
    "        - Continue until you reach 1\n",
    "    - Right: Doubling (Put in second multiplier)\n",
    "        - Each row doubles the previous\n",
    "        - Continue until you have as many entries as in the halving column\n",
    "- Cross out every row in which the halving column contains an even number.\n",
    "- Sum whats left in the doubling column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because the doubling column is essentially the second number * powers of 2 (number * 2 ^ 0, number * 2 ^ 1, number * 2 ^ 2, etc.)\n",
    " - See page 17, too lazy to type out formulas.\n",
    " \n",
    "... \"If you number the rows of the halving column ...now notice the crucial pattern: those row numbers are exactly the exponents in the expression for 89 that we found ... the odd entries will always have row numbers that are the exponents in a sum of powers of 2 equaling our original number.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Other Words:\n",
    "\n",
    "***RPM is an algorithm inside of an algorithm.*** \n",
    "- The halving column is an implementation of an algorithm that finds the sum of powers of 2 that equals the number at the top of the column. (Binary Expansion of 2)\n",
    "    - \"100\" in binary is 1 x 2^2 + 0 x 2^1 + 0 x 2^0\n",
    "        Which means \"4\"\n",
    "- Then we run the full algorithm to repeat the multiplication process\n",
